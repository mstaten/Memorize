# Theme Chooser

Welcome to Theme Chooser!
This repository contains the code for a project developed while following along with the Stanford course
[CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS using SwiftUI](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/2023), which is available online.

## Overview
Theme Chooser is an interactive project that allows users to choose from a set of default themes or create their 
own custom themes. 
Each theme consists of a color palette and a set of emojis. 
Users can then play a game of Memorize, where they match cards that utilize elements from the selected theme.

## Features
* Choose from default themes or create custom themes
* Play a game of Memorize with cards based on the selected theme
* Customize themes with unique color palettes and emoji sets
* Track and display game statistics, such as score and time

## Credits
The initial codebase and structure of this project were heavily influenced by the course materials.
I coded along during the lectures, including my own notes and using my preferred syntax.
Subsequently, additional features were added during homework assignments, expanding the functionality of the
application.
This was a great way to brush up on Swift and learn some additional best practices.

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructor of the course for his excellent lectures, wonderfully
detailed assignments, and online resources.
